# About

A quick Django site to show how to query a database, restructure the data, send it to a view and then populate multiple dynamic dropdown boxes. The database contains a list of users with their associated country and city of origin. The dropdown boxes first let you choose the country, then the city, then the user.

# Requirements

pip install django==1.11.1
